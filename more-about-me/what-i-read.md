#### What I read

I mainly read on kindle, love the eink screen and no distraction, totaly immersed. 

I have two kindles, a kindle oasis bought at 2018, used till today, still works very well.

A kindle scribe, bought at 2023, heavier, bigger screen, better for reading coding books and blog articles.

Amazon build a chrome extension, can easily push web pages to your kindle, I love it. 

For long blog articles, I always push to kinde and read on it. Just too many distractions from computer or browser.
