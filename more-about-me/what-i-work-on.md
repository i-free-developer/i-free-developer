During the past few months, I coded not too much.
  - Upgraded a Rails app to latest Rails(7.1.3.4)
  - rewrite the exited PadelX wechat mini program, using wechat mini program native, no more frameworks. It was build via wepy framework, not easy to upgrade, so I rewrite it.
  - refresh morden HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, finished some Freecodecamp projects
